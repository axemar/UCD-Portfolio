# UCD MSc Advanced AI Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **GitHub portfolio**, which gathers all the academic projects, notebooks, and practical exercises I completed during my **Master of Science Advanced Artificial Intelligence** at University College Dublin.

This repository mainly contains Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) developed as part of coursework, labs, and academic projects.  
These works are not production-ready applications, but **well-documented implementations of core concepts** learned throughout my studies at UCD.

The goal of this portfolio is to:
- Demonstrate my technical skills in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence
- Showcase my understanding of theoretical and practical concepts
- Provide clear explanations of my methodologies and results
- Track my progress and learning throughout my MSc degree

## UCD Modules

All of the projects on this portfolio are built based around some learning concepts of the UCD MSc AAI's modules.

### Advanced Machine Learning

Focused on advanced and state-of-the-art machine learning methods, including deep learning, ensemble models, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and human-in-the-loop systems.  
Developed the ability to select, implement, and evaluate appropriate ML algorithms using Python-based toolkits.  
Emphasized critical understanding of algorithmic design, performance evaluation, and the societal impact of machine learning.

### Computer Vision And Imaging

Focused on applying modern AI and deep learning techniques to vision and imaging tasks, including image classification, object detection, segmentation, and enhancement.  
Developed hands-on experience with state-of-the-art architectures such as CNNs, Vision Transformers, and generative models (GANs, diffusion), using transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies.  
Built the ability to critically evaluate vision models, interpret their behavior, and assess their strengths and limitations across real-world application domains.

### Foundations Deep Learning

Introduced the core principles of modern deep learning, covering neural network fundamentals, optimization, backpropagation, and regularization.  
Developed practical skills in designing, training, and evaluating deep learning models for computer vision and natural language processing using frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.  
Explored advanced architectures including CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and generative models (VAEs, GANs, diffusion), with a critical assessment of their strengths and limitations.

### Optimisation

Introduced core optimisation techniques, including linear and integer programming, convex optimisation, and gradient-based methods used in modern AI systems.  
Developed the ability to model and solve real-world optimisation problemsin terms of linear programming and integer linear programming and to apply the basic optimisation techniques to solve machine learning problems.  
Built a solid understanding of convex optimisation foundations underlying machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including gradient-based approaches and its variants.
