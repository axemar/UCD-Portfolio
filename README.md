# UCD MSc Advanced AI Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my University College Dublin **GitHub Portfolio** !

Here are gathered all the labs and projects I completed during my **MSc Advanced Artificial Intelligence** at UCD.

This repository mainly contains Jupyter notebooks `.ipynb` representing my initial, hands-on implementations of the concepts learned.

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks showcasing my initial hands-on implementations of learned concepts.

## Objective

The objective of this portfolio is to:
- Demonstrate my technical skills in Data Science and AI
- Showcase my understanding of theoretical concepts
- Provide clear explanations of my methodologies and results
- Track my progress and learning throughout my MSc degree

## Projects

All of the projects on this portfolio are built based around some learning concepts of the UCD MSc AAI's modules.

### Advanced Machine Learning

- Focused on advanced and state-of-the-art machine learning methods, including deep learning, ensemble models, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and human-in-the-loop systems.  
- Developed the ability to implement, and evaluate appropriate ML algorithms using Python-based toolkits.  
- Emphasized critical understanding of algorithmic design, performance evaluation, and societal impact.
